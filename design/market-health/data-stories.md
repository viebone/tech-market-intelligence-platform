# Market Health - Data Stories

## Purpose

A **data story** is a predefined user question with a fixed answer structure and live data.
The question and presentation are authored ahead of time; the figures are computed when the
user asks for the story. A story is not a stored answer, a static report, or a new navigation
task.

Stories are the fast, deterministic layer of the market-health conversation. The system
checks the story catalogue before invoking an LLM. A matching story runs its owned-data
queries, fills its prepared sections, and reports that no model was used. A question that
does not match a story continues through the existing conversational routing and LLM path.

## Catalogue rules

Each story is documented as one catalogue entry containing:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable identifier for routing and analytics |
| `display_name` | Short label for the Task Panel item (added 2026-09-04). May differ from `question` — a nav label, not a sentence. E.g. "What we know about the market" for the question "What do we currently know about the tech job market?". Required so the Task Panel and the Welcome's shortcut list can be built entirely from this catalogue, with no per-story frontend copy. |
| `question` | The canonical user-facing question, shown as the clickable shortcut text in the Welcome and as the opening prompt for the task |
| `example_phrasings` | A small set of equivalent phrasings accepted by the matcher |
| `audience_job` | The decision or understanding the story supports |
| `sections` | Fixed ordered answer sections, each with its own data contract |
| `queries` | Owned-data aggregates required to fill the sections |
| `freshness_rule` | The timestamp and source coverage shown with the answer |
| `limitations` | Conditions that must be disclosed rather than inferred around |
| `no_data_state` | Exact behaviour when a section has insufficient coverage |

Adding a story should be a catalogue operation: add one entry, its aggregate query, its
deterministic renderer, and focused tests. It must not require changing the generic chat
router, source adapter interface, or frontend conversation shell. It also must not require
changing the Welcome (below) — the Welcome reads this catalogue at request time, so a new
entry here appears there automatically.

## Relationship to the Welcome

Added 2026-09-04 — `changes/2026-09-04-about-this-platform-welcome.md`. **"About this
platform"** (see `design/market-health/experience.md` — Opening Welcome) is the Task Panel's
pinned, always-first, always-default item. It is **not a catalogue entry** — it has no row in
this file, no `id` in the catalogue sense, and it is never itself matched by the chat router.
Instead, at request time it reads this catalogue's `id` and `question` for every current entry
(the same shape `list_stories()`/`GET /api/market-health/stories` already returns) and renders
one shortcut per entry. Adding, removing, or reordering a story here changes what the Welcome
offers with no change to the Welcome's own code, copy, or spec. Selecting a shortcut opens that
story's own task — the Welcome does not compute or cache an answer on a story's behalf.

## Story 1 - What do we currently know about the tech job market?

### Display name

**What we know about the market** — the Task Panel item label. Distinct from the question
below, which is the sentence shown as the clickable shortcut and used as the task's opening
prompt.

### User question

> What do we currently know about the tech job market?

### Audience job

Give a professional a fast, honest orientation to the platform's current evidence before
they ask a narrower market question or commit to a job search.

### Visible answer shape

The answer uses this order. The headings and explanation style are fixed; the values are live.
The visible version is intentionally concise and uses plain, business-oriented language.

It opens with one short market read, followed by no more than three supporting facts and one
coverage note. It does not expose source adapter names, database fields, query names, model
names, or extraction mechanics in the visible story. Those remain available in the Reasoning
Panel.

1. **Market read** - one or two sentences describing the broad picture in the roles and
   companies the platform currently tracks.
2. **What stands out** - up to three simple facts, chosen from job volume, role mix, skills,
   compensation coverage, or geography.
3. **Coverage note** - when collection began and the main limitation on what the platform can
   currently say.

### Data contract

The story may use only platform-owned data from `raw_postings`, `classifications`,
`posting_skills`, `posting_requirements`, and their source metadata. It may not use an LLM,
external search, or unstated market assumptions to fill a value.

| Story fact | Aggregate | Required qualifier |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage window | `min(raw_postings.fetched_at)`, `max(raw_postings.fetched_at)` | Observation window; not historical market coverage |
| Dataset size | `count(distinct raw_postings.id)` | Unique captured postings, not total jobs in the market |
| Companies | `count(distinct raw_postings.company)` | Only non-null normalized company values |
| Sources | `count(distinct raw_postings.source)` and source names | Source adapters that contributed rows |
| Role distribution | Classified rows grouped by `role_category` | Classification coverage and sample size |
| Titles/specializations | Classified rows grouped by raw title and specialization | Only classified postings; unknown/other remain visible as coverage limits |
| Skills | `posting_skills` grouped by `skill_group` and `requirement_level` | Posting sample size; mentions are interpreted extraction, not verified facts |
| Compensation | `salary_confidence` grouped by `structured` and `parsed` | Structured and parsed figures are never blended |
| Geography | Non-null `country` and `city` grouped separately | Normalized-location coverage; null locations are not guessed |

### Honesty and empty states

- Counts are current as of the response's query time and carry a data-freshness label.
- Percentages use the relevant denominator and state the sample size.
- A section with too little data says **"Not enough data yet"** and explains what coverage is
  missing. It does not disappear silently and it does not borrow from external sources.
- `unknown`, `other`, null, and unclassified records are not silently converted into a known
  role, title, skill, company, or location.
- The story must distinguish "no rows exist" from "rows exist but this field is not yet
  populated".
- The response includes a provenance entry naming the queried platform tables/aggregates and
  explicitly states **"No language model used"**.

### Relationship to the existing experience

This story is a dedicated Query Task named **"What we know about the market"**, placed above
**"Tech market hiring status"** in the Task Panel. Selecting it replaces the working-space
content with the concise briefing. It does not replace the hiring-status task or create a
dashboard. The resulting story is an AI-turn-shaped output so it can use the same Reasoning
Panel and Output Panel reference pattern as other market-health outputs.

## Future catalogue direction

Later entries can cover narrower questions such as role demand, skills by specialization,
compensation coverage, source coverage, layoff activity, or market changes over time. New
ingestion types (company websites, layoff portals, papers, and other sources) add source
adapters and source-specific aggregates; they do not change the meaning of this story's
source-aware contract. A future story may use those sources only after its own data contract
defines what they can support and how provenance is shown.
